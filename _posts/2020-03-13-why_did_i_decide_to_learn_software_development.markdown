It all began when I joined Addis Ababa University to learn Information systems back in 2006.

I was motivated, ambitious and ready to take on a challenge, There were only  afew students selected to study the subject, based on our high school grades, and we were the first graduates from the university in the  information systems department. I spent 3 years studying and graduated, but unfortunately I wasn’t able to continue working with my degree. Instead I started working in a shipping company.

All during those years until today in my mind I knew that I wanted to continue learning technology. However for a lot of reasons and life circumstances it wasn’t easy. Now after all those years, finally, here I am chasing my dream.

I would like to be a software engineer for reasons. First, it has been my dream throughout my adult life to become one. I am passionate about technology, and I believe it will help me think differently, help me solve problems and give me the freedom of working anywhere in the world.  Also I believe by learning to code I  will be learning a lifetime skill. There are so many different projects and working on so many different ideas makes it special. I will never be bored on my job; instead I will continuously be learning and working to achieve something, which for me is priceless.
