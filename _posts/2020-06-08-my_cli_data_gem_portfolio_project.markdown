                                        ********  "One way or another, you will get there, keep going!"  ********

With my inspirational motto,  I have finally done my first final project on Ruby Object-Oriented Programming for Flatiron School, I developed a simple CLI gem about Beer that prompt the user for input in order to list out Beer types and its details.

Although thinking of doing the project on my own was nerve-racking, at the same time it was exciting.
At first, I wasn’t sure where to begin with and if I am able to do and finish the project on time, but deep down I knew I would learn through it and I will get there, after referring an intro video by my cohort instructor Michael Doherty and also other Flatiron School videos I was ready for my project.

After deciding of the idea on what I am going to work on, I carry on with my work project setup on IDE in Browser and created my repository in GitHub to get going with my project.

I started the project by installing bundler and creating my project directory and file folders, followed by writing a short human readable project note for myself stating what I want my project to do.

Also, it was important to figure out the MVP(minimal viable product) for the functionality of the program as per my project portfolio which leads me to create a class that can handle Api get requests, a class that creates and save objects and a class that can handle all input and output for the project.

Learning to set up my application environment to make the application run and create an executable file using a line called shebang line, which tells our terminal which is the executable file and what files to run and see the class’s I have created connected and running properly was exciting and from there I carried on coding one by one and while doing it I have learnt a lot and indeed this project was an eye-opener for me.

Now I am looking forward for the next lessons ahead and to experience more challenges and to learn more.
